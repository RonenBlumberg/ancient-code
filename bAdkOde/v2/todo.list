put each line of the file into a dynamic string array.
parse entire file and get all errors
get locations of functions (array locations)
if import statments are encountered, the corresponding import statement is
replaced by code from the import file
you were working on Interpeter.java, putting everything into a vector... implemented the vector part... now you need to put some modifications in badkode.java and interpreter.java to fulfill this crazy scheme.
>>>
Each import file is interpreted separately by the Script object. Visibility is provided to all functions and types defined in the file.

You were working on finishing the implementing the input statement.
Specifically, you were working on delimeters.

>>>

Delimeters is finished. You are working on var - the part on inputting variables and storing
values.

[just a thought - consider implementing file reading and writing]

After this, move onto SymbolTable.java and clean up the mess there...
