This is a bAdkOde script.
The interpreter was created in Java by Vivin Suresh Paliath.

This interpreter, as of now, supports:

1. The Print statement with all escape characters and concatenation.
2. Creation (with casting) and Printing of variables.
3. Input into variables (defined or undefined).

The Print statement in bAdkOde takes the following form:

An example is:

>"Goodbye Cruel World!";

Now the torture test for the print statement!

\\\""\\"+++;;;;";";"+"+\;\;\;\+\+\+"""\\"
